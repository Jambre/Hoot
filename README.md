# Hoot

Hoot is a software front-end for lotide that provides a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface. 

# Prerequisites

Hoot expects a working [lotide](https://git.sr.ht/~vpzom/lotide) server on the same domain name, accessible under /api.

# Build

You'll need node/npm to build Hoot. Building is simple:
```
npm install
npm build
```

After the build is completed, the results are output to the dist/ directory. Copy those files to your web root and Hoot should now be accessible.
