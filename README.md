# Project Hoot UI mockups

We're attempting a live UI mockup/wireframe experiment using Vue + Vuetify.  

There's a good chance this will be the frontend stack in production, so we may be able to feed two birds with one scone by using this stack to iterate on the UI until we have an _actual production UI_ ready to deploy.

At the moment, the `master` branch of this repo is being hosted (by vcavallo) on Netlify at https://hoot-ui-mockup.netlify.app/
